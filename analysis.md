# Brief Analysis

### 1. The implemented neural network from scratch using NumPy successfully classifies images from 3 selected classes of the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
### 2. After training for 50 epochs, the model achieved over 60% accuracy on the test set, fulfilling the required performance benchmark. 
### 3. The loss curve showed a smooth decrease, indicating proper convergence of the gradient descent algorithm. 
### 4. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were computed per class, and the results revealed that while the network learns distinguishing features for each class, there were notable misclassifications between similar-looking categories (e.g., airplane and bird). 
### 5. The confusion matrix helped visualize these confusions. Overall, the model performed reasonably well for a simple feedforward network without optimizations like momentum or regularization. 
### The project demonstrates how fundamental neural network components work together and provides insight into tuning parameters to achieve better results.
