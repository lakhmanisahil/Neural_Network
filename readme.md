# Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a basic neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the training script:
```
python main.py
```

## Notes
- The model trains a 3-layer neural network using forward/backward propagation and gradient descent.
- CIFAR-10 data is loaded and preprocessed using the provided data loader.
